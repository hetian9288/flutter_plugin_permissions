IOS 端使用ObjeC重写

## Features

* Check if a permission is granted.
* Request permission for a specific feature.
* Open app settings so the user can enable a permission.
* Show a rationale for requesting permission (Android).

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `permission_handler` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/). For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  permission_handler: '^2.1.1'
```

> **NOTE:** There's a known issue with integrating plugins that use Swift into a Flutter project created with the Objective-C template. See issue [Flutter#16049](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16049) for help on integration.

## API

### Requesting permission

``` dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

Map<PermissionGroup, PermissionStatus> permissions = await PermissionHandler().requestPermissions([PermissionGroup.contacts]);
```

### Checking permission

``` dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

PermissionStatus permission = await PermissionHandler().checkPermissionStatus(PermissionGroup.contacts);
```

### Open app settings

``` dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

bool isOpened = await PermissionHandler().openAppSettings();
```

### Show a rationale for requesting permission (Android only)

``` dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

bool isShown = await PermissionHandler().shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale(PermissionGroup.contacts);
```

This will always return `false` on iOS.

### List of available permissions

``` dart
enum PermissionGroup {
  /// The unknown permission only used for return type, never requested

  /// Android: None

  mediaLibrary
}
```

### Status of the permission

Defines the state of a permission group

``` dart
enum PermissionStatus {
  /// Permission to access the requested feature is denied by the user.
  denied,

  /// The feature is disabled (or not available) on the device.
  disabled,

  /// Permission to access the requested feature is granted by the user.
  granted,

  /// The user granted restricted access to the requested feature (only on iOS).
  restricted,

  /// Permission is in an unknown state
